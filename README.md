# Minishell
####  As beautiful as a shell

A 42 project (with [Acuna @ojospeh](https://github.com/acunathink)), where we implemented a simple POSIX Shell in C. The program parses a prompt, launches with arguments and executables, and also works with built-in functions which were written by our team.
